## Repository for Algorithms HW1.

### Implementations of bubble sort and quick sort
Two implementations of two algorithms for sorting numbers. Functions in `algs.py` take in a sequence, sort,
and return. Time tests were done to check time complexity of the algorithms.

Note timing and plotting scripts require additional packages not explicitly listed in requirements.txt file:
* matplotlib
* tqdm
* timeit
* pickle
